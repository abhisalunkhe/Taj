                             <p><b><sup>The</sup></b> Taj Mahal is actually an integrated complex of structures with the white domed marble mausoleum 
                    being its most significant component. Entrusted to a board-of-architects by the Emperor Shah Jahan, the construction 
                    of the Taj Complex began about 1631 AD. The principal mausoleum was completed in 1648 AD by employing thousands of 
                    artisans and craftsmen, whereas, the outlying buildings and gardens were finished five years later in 1653 AD.</p>

                <p> Taj, the ultimate expression of love speaks volumes of indulgence coming from an overflowing treasury and political security 
                    of that era and much more by way of the finesse in art and science of architecture. Herringbone inlays define the space between 
                    many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the whitemarbles. 
                    Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour, creating geometric patterns of 
                    considerable complexity. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns. The inlay stones are of 
                    yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.</p>
